Next step in this project would be:
  1) create web access to dashboard - done
  2) make dashboard clickable i.e., a click on any segment of a pie chart will update the whole dashboard based on underlying data
  3) understand end purpose of customers' segmentation and set cluster perfomance metric
  4) use more granular data for clustering (e.g., daily)
  5) use external data (e.g., geodata, social media interests)
